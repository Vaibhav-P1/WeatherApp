# 🌤️ Modern Weather App

I'm excited to share my latest project — a modern Weather App that delivers **real-time weather data** with a clean and responsive UI. 📱

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Weather App provides accurate, real-time weather information using API calls.  
It presents key data points like temperature, humidity, and wind speed in a **clean card-based layout**, fully built using Jetpack Compose for a smooth and native Android experience.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- ✅ **Kotlin** – Modern language for Android development  
- 🎨 **Jetpack Compose** – Declarative UI framework  
- 🔁 **Retrofit** – API calls and JSON parsing  
- 🧱 **MVVM Architecture** – Clean, testable, and maintainable code structure
